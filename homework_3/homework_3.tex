\section*{Theorem 3.12}
    The vertex cover problem is NP-complete.

\begin{proof}
    We will proof this problem is NP-complete by proofing this is both in NP and NP-hard.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{NP:} \\
        We will proof that the vertex cover problem is in NP by showing that the certificate is the vertex cover.\\
        Given the graph $G = (V,E)$ and k is interger.\\
        \textbf{Certificate:} A set of vertices, the vertex cover $V'\subseteq V$\\
        \textbf{Verifier:} Check if the set $V'$ is a vertex cover of size k in $G$.\\
        If the set $V'$ is a vertex cover of size k in $G$, then the certificate is accepted.\\
        If the certificate is accepted, then the set $V'$ is a vertex cover of size k in $G$.\\
        \textbf{Proof:} The verifier can check if the set $V'$ is a vertex cover of size k in $G$ by checking if for every edge $(u,v) \in E$, either $u \in V'$ or $v \in V'$.\\
        The running time is polynominal time thus the vertex cover problem is in NP.

        \item \textbf{NP-hard:} \\
        We will proof that the vertex cover problem is NP-hard by reducing the vertex cover problem to the clique problem.\\
        Given the graph $G = (V,E)$ and k is interger.\\
        \textbf{Reduction:} Construct a new graph $G' = (V',E')$ where $V' = V$ and $E' = \{(u,v) | (u,v) \notin E\}$.\\
        \textbf{Claim:} $G$ has a vertex cover of size k if and only if $G'$ has a clique of size $|V| - k$.\\
        \textbf{Proof:} \\
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If $G$ has a vertex cover of size k, then $G'$ has a clique of size $|V| - k$.\\
            Let $V'$ be the vertex cover of size k in $G$.\\
            Let $V'' = V - V'$, then $|V''| = |V| - k$.\\
            Since $V'$ is the vertex cover of size k in $G$, then for every edge $(u,v) \in E$, either $u \in V'$ or $v \in V'$.\\
            Thus, for every edge $(u,v) \notin E$, both $u \in V''$ and $v \in V''$.\\
            Therefore, $V''$ is a clique of size $|V| - k$ in $G'$.
            \item If $G'$ has a clique of size $|V| - k$, then $G$ has a vertex cover of size k.\\
            Let $V''$ be the clique of size $|V| - k$ in $G'$.\\
            Let $V' = V - V''$, then $|V'| = k$.\\
            Since $V''$ is the clique of size $|V| - k$ in $G'$, then for every edge $(u,v) \notin E$, both $u \in V''$ and $v \in V''$.\\
            Thus, for every edge $(u,v) \in E$, either $u \in V'$ or $v \in V'$.\\
            In other words, for every edge $(u,v) \in E$, at least one of $u$ and $v$ is in $V'$.\\
            $V-V'$ is a clique of size $|V| - |V'| = k$ in $G$.\\
            Therefore, $V'$ is the vertex cover of size k in $G$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    Since the vertex cover problem is both in NP and NP-hard, the vertex cover problem is NP-complete.

\end{proof}
